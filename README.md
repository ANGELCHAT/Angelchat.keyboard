# LiveChat Emoji Keyboard

Agent App Widget for Emoji Keyboard in the LiveChat app.

## Getting Started

Remember that this project is available as a public app in LiveChat marketplace. You can install it via [this link](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/apps?install=NxBGpEfqXnnBFKeF). The following instructions will guide you through installation process required for development.

### Prerequisites

Emoji Keyboard is a front-end app only, so you donâ€™t need back-end server to run it. We use `npm` manager to include and install modules. [Here is how to install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

The project also uses `SASS` as stylesheets pre-processor. [Here is how to install it](https://sass-lang.com/install).

```
npm install
```

And that's all! Now you have own fully functional fork of Emoji Keyboard ðŸ˜Ž

## Development and Deployment

Code mostly speaks for itself. However, there are a few points that you should remember about:
* as LiveChat Agent App Widget SDK is loaded via `npm`, it is more convenient for development process to use node.js packages only
* to run `npm` packages on visitorâ€™s end, we use a tool called `browserify` and create the `bundle.js` file
* for production builds we minify JS code using the `tinyify` plugin and `babelify` for compatibility with ES5
